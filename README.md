# Project 1: Day Trading Strategy Analysis
### Part 1:

In depth analysis of my day trading strategy covering data from dozens of trades with real money. The data features many variables other than Entry/Exit stock prices in order to get a better picture and support future desicions. 


### [Data Collection and Filtering:](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zoxfog/Day-Trading-Analysis/blob/main/Data_Collection_and_Filtering.ipynb)
Import data from local files and supplement it with extra stock data from Yahoo Finance.
### [Data Cleaning:](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zoxfog/Day-Trading-Analysis/blob/main/Data_Cleaning.ipynb) 
Clean the data from outlier and unsusual values.
### [EDA and Preprocessing:](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zoxfog/Day-Trading-Analysis/blob/main/EDA_and_Preprocessing.ipynb)
Preprocess the data and visualize both the raw and preprocessed data while drawing inference.
### [Modeling and Conclusions:](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zoxfog/Day-Trading-Analysis/blob/main/Modeling.ipynb)
Implement ML models for dimensionality reduction and classification and draw conclusions.

### Part 2: (in progress)

This part is a follow up to part 1, here we download all the necessary data down to the 1-minute open, close, high, low and volume bars to retrieve better insight and accuracy.
we also address the issues that came up in the previous project and start creating a foundation for algo-trading, for example find preferabe pre-trade attributes for stock picking using agents and start training the data for reinforcement learning.


### [Raw Data Extraction:](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zoxfog/Day-Trading-Analysis-2/blob/main/Raw_Data_Extraction.ipynb) 
Retrieve 1-minute, 1 day and 1 hour stock data from Interactive Brokers and Yahoo Finance, and store the new data locally. This procedure is implemented on a daily basis. 
### [Main Notebook:](https://nbviewer.org/github/zoxfog/Day-Trading-Analysis-2/blob/e36a20c2cb53c4e91430cc714308178c423f64e6/main.ipynb)
The main notebook of the project, here we will conduct all of the pre processing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, modeling and algorithmic design.
